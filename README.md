This project sets up a 5G New Radio (NR) simulation in NS-3 using a topology consisting of 4 gNBs (Next Generation NodeBs) and multiple UEs (User Equipments) to study NR behavior and performance in a multi-cell environment. The goal is to simulate real-world NR scenarios including inter-cell interference, handovers, and SINR/throughput evaluation.
